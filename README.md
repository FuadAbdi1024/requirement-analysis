# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository contains notes, templates, and examples related to the process of **Requirement Analysis** in software development.

Requirement analysis is a crucial first step in the software engineering lifecycle, aimed at understanding the customer's needs and defining clear, actionable, and testable requirements for the system to be developed. This repo is intended for learners, developers, or anyone looking to strengthen their understanding of this phase in the software development process.

## 📌 What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a foundational phase in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** where the needs, expectations, and constraints of stakeholders are identified, analyzed, and documented. It serves as the blueprint for what the system is supposed to do and forms the basis for all subsequent development activities.

### 🔍 Purpose of Requirement Analysis

The main goal is to ensure that everyone—clients, users, developers, and testers—shares a **common understanding** of what the software will deliver.

### 🧱 Key Activities Involved:
- **Elicitation:** Gathering requirements through interviews, surveys, observations, or documentation.
- **Analysis:** Identifying conflicts, redundancies, or missing pieces in the gathered data.
- **Specification:** Writing clear, concise, and detailed requirements documents (e.g., SRS).
- **Validation:** Ensuring the documented requirements are complete, feasible, and aligned with business goals.
- **Management:** Tracking changes and maintaining requirement versions throughout the project.

### ⚙️ Types of Requirements
- **Functional Requirements:** What the system should do (features, workflows).
- **Non-Functional Requirements:** How the system performs (security, scalability, usability).
- **Business Requirements:** High-level goals from a business perspective.
- **User Requirements:** Specific needs of the system’s end users.

### 🚀 Importance in SDLC
- Acts as the **foundation** for design, development, and testing.
- Reduces the risk of **scope creep** and misunderstandings.
- Ensures that the final product **meets user needs** and expectations.
- Saves time and cost by minimizing rework due to unclear or missed requirements.

## ✅ Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis plays a crucial role in the success of any software project. It sets the foundation for the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Here are three key reasons why it is critical:

### 1. 🎯 Ensures Clear Understanding of Project Scope
Requirement analysis helps stakeholders and development teams agree on **what the software should do**. By clearly defining the scope early, it minimizes misunderstandings, prevents scope creep, and aligns everyone’s expectations.

### 2. 🛠 Reduces Development Errors and Rework
Well-defined and validated requirements reduce the chances of building incorrect or incomplete functionality. This leads to **fewer bugs**, less rework, and **saves time and cost** during development and testing phases.

### 3. 📈 Improves Product Quality and User Satisfaction
By gathering and analyzing real user needs and business goals, requirement analysis ensures that the end product **solves the right problem** and provides value to its users. This results in higher quality software and **greater user satisfaction**.

## 🔧 Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves a series of structured activities that help define and manage software requirements effectively. Below are the five key activities:

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  Collecting initial input from stakeholders, customers, end users, and subject matter experts to understand their needs and expectations for the software system.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Using techniques such as interviews, questionnaires, workshops, brainstorming, and observations to draw out detailed and accurate requirements from stakeholders.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  Writing down the collected requirements in a structured format (like Software Requirements Specification - SRS) that can be clearly understood by both technical and non-technical teams.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Organizing and analyzing the gathered requirements to identify conflicts, overlaps, or gaps. This also involves creating models like use cases, process flows, and data diagrams to visualize the requirements.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  Verifying that the documented requirements are complete, clear, feasible, and aligned with business objectives. This often includes reviews, walkthroughs, and feedback sessions with stakeholders.

  ## 📚 Types of Requirements

In software development, requirements are generally categorized into **Functional** and **Non-functional** requirements. Both are essential to delivering a successful and complete system.

### ✅ Functional Requirements

Functional requirements define **what the system should do**—they describe specific behaviors, features, and interactions.

For a **Booking Management Project**, examples include:

- Users should be able to **create an account and log in** using their email and password.
- Customers can **search for available bookings** based on date, time, and location.
- The system must allow users to **create, view, update, and cancel bookings**.
- Admin users should be able to **view all bookings**, filter them by status (confirmed, pending, canceled), and manage user accounts.
- Users should receive **email or SMS notifications** upon successful booking or cancellation.

### ⚙️ Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements describe **how the system performs** its functions. These are quality attributes such as performance, usability, security, and reliability.
For the same Booking Management Project, examples include:

- The system should load **search results within 2 seconds**.
- The platform should support **up to 10,000 concurrent users** without crashing.
- All user data must be **encrypted at rest and in transit** to ensure data security.
- The interface should be **mobile-responsive** and usable on all modern browsers.
- The system must have **99.9% uptime** during business hours.
