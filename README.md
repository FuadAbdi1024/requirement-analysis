# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository contains notes, templates, and examples related to the process of **Requirement Analysis** in software development.

Requirement analysis is a crucial first step in the software engineering lifecycle, aimed at understanding the customer's needs and defining clear, actionable, and testable requirements for the system to be developed. This repo is intended for learners, developers, or anyone looking to strengthen their understanding of this phase in the software development process.

## 📌 What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a foundational phase in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** where the needs, expectations, and constraints of stakeholders are identified, analyzed, and documented. It serves as the blueprint for what the system is supposed to do and forms the basis for all subsequent development activities.

### 🔍 Purpose of Requirement Analysis

The main goal is to ensure that everyone—clients, users, developers, and testers—shares a **common understanding** of what the software will deliver.

### 🧱 Key Activities Involved:
- **Elicitation:** Gathering requirements through interviews, surveys, observations, or documentation.
- **Analysis:** Identifying conflicts, redundancies, or missing pieces in the gathered data.
- **Specification:** Writing clear, concise, and detailed requirements documents (e.g., SRS).
- **Validation:** Ensuring the documented requirements are complete, feasible, and aligned with business goals.
- **Management:** Tracking changes and maintaining requirement versions throughout the project.

### ⚙️ Types of Requirements
- **Functional Requirements:** What the system should do (features, workflows).
- **Non-Functional Requirements:** How the system performs (security, scalability, usability).
- **Business Requirements:** High-level goals from a business perspective.
- **User Requirements:** Specific needs of the system’s end users.

### 🚀 Importance in SDLC
- Acts as the **foundation** for design, development, and testing.
- Reduces the risk of **scope creep** and misunderstandings.
- Ensures that the final product **meets user needs** and expectations.
- Saves time and cost by minimizing rework due to unclear or missed requirements.
